Button.jsx
Changes made:

Moved the variant and size default values to the function arguments in Button.
Used default values in the function arguments for variant and size to ensure they default to "default" if not provided.
Simplified the return statement in Button by removing unnecessary parentheses.
Removed unnecessary imports in the Button component.
Used object destructuring in the Button component function arguments for cleaner code.




Reasons for refactoring:

Improved readability: The refactored code is more readable and easier to understand.
Reduced redundancy: Default values are now specified in the function arguments, reducing redundancy in the code.
Simplified code: The refactored code is more concise and uses modern JavaScript features for cleaner code.

2. Dialog.jsx

Changes made:
Used forwardRef to wrap DialogOverlay, DialogContent, DialogTitle, and DialogDescription components to maintain proper ref forwarding.
Simplified the class names by using string interpolation and removing redundant class names.
Removed unnecessary comments and improved formatting for better readability.
These changes help to simplify the code structure, improve readability, and maintainability.


3. Input.jsx

Extracted class names: I extracted the logic for generating the className attribute into a separate variable inputClassNames. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, especially if the class names need to be updated or modified in the future.

Formatted the JSX: I formatted the JSX code to be more readable. This includes properly indenting the code and using consistent spacing.

Removed unnecessary parentheses: I removed unnecessary parentheses around the <input> element. In JSX, parentheses are only required when returning multiple elements or when using JSX fragments.

Refactored className prop: Instead of directly passing className to the <input> element, I passed the inputClassNames variable. This separates the logic for generating class names from the JSX, making the code cleaner.

Overall, these changes improve the readability and maintainability of the Input component, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.
